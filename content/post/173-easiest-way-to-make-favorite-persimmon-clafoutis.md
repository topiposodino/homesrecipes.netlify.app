Whisk milk, sugars, eggs, almond extract, salt, and flour together until smooth and combined. If time permits, let batter rest overnight for better hydration and a more tender custard. Persimmon Clafoutis I wanted to use up the persimmons that we received as a gift. This dessert is similar to baked pudding, which is a little firmer than regular pudding.

I decided to make a typical Christmas inspired clafoutis with three seasonal fruits: oranges, persimmon, and dried cranberries.
