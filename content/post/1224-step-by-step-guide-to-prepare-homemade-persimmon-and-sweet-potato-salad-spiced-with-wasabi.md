recipeinstructions:
- "Combine the ☆ ingredients. Combine the wasabi with honey first, add lemon juice and salt, then finally the oil to emulsify."
- "Cut the cucumbers lengthwise into half, then into diagonal slices. Mince the onions. Combine in a bowl, rub with a pinch of salt (not listed), and let rest."
