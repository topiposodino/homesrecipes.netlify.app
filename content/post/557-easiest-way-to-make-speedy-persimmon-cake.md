Hey everyone, I hope you are having an incredible day today. Today, we're going to prepare a special dish, persimmon cake. It is one of my favorites food recipes. For mine, I am going to make it a bit unique. This will be really delicious.

The walnuts add studs of crunch to the silky-smooth cake. Although this cake makes for a show-stopping seasonal dessert, a leftover slice—quickly toasted—would also make a lovely breakfast. This cake simply exudes holiday spirit. If you can&#39;t find fresh persimmons at your local grocery store, don&#39;t fret: Persimmon pulp can be ordered online.
