Hey everyone, it is Brad, welcome to my recipe site. Today, I will show you a way to make a special dish, persimmon pound cake for the autumn season. One of my favorites. This time, I am going to make it a bit tasty. This will be really delicious.

Persimmon Pound Cake for the Autumn Season is one of the most favored of recent trending foods on earth. It is appreciated by millions every day. It is simple, it's quick, it tastes delicious. Persimmon Pound Cake for the Autumn Season is something which I've loved my whole life. They're fine and they look wonderful.

Great recipe for Persimmon Pound Cake for the Autumn Season. I wanted to make a cake suitable for the autumn season so I adjusted another recipe of mine and added a chopped persimmon. I used a hard and unripe persimmon, but it&#39;s best with a very ripe persimmon. In that case, decrease the amount.


To get started with this recipe, we have to first prepare a few ingredients. You can cook persimmon pound cake for the autumn season using 6 ingredients and 10 steps. Here is how you can achieve that.

##### The ingredients needed to make Persimmon Pound Cake for the Autumn Season:

1. Make ready 150 grams Pancake mix
1. Get 1 Persimmon
1. Make ready 40 grams Sugar
1. Take 1 Egg
1. Get 30 grams Margarine (or butter)
1. Prepare 30 grams Plain yogurt


Stir in persimmon pulp, oil, melted butter, and eggs until well incorporated; stir in walnuts. It is the right cake for the autumn, a simple one perfect for a break in the afternoon: it has a slightly nutty taste given by the whole spelt flour, a caramel hint thanks to the moist muscovado cane sugar and slices of juicy persimmons, the fruit that best represents the season of flaming colours, the smell of fireplaces and the need of something cosy and warming to go with a cup of steaming black tea. This pudding cake is super moist and chewy, similar to an English toffee pudding cake. The persimmon fruit is a very mild tasting fruit, especially when it&#39;s baked, so I added some cinnamon and brown sugar to make it more flavorful.
