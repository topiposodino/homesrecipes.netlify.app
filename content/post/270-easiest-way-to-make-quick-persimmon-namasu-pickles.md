I chose daikon radish, carrot, persimmon, and pomegranate for my sunomono. I cut the daikon, carrot, and persimmon into matchsticks, and tossed them with the pomegranate arils. I made a light dressing from rice vinegar, sugar, and salt, and added a bit of dashi to soften the flavor. Kaki Namasu: Pickled daikon and carrot with dried persimmon Symbolizes progress, education and culture Time/Effort: * Cost: * Flavour: *** Dried persimmon adds a luscious sweetness to this pickle, but it is not something I&#39;ve come across outside of Japan, although they are a common sight in winter here, when it&#39;s slim pickings for fresh fruit.
