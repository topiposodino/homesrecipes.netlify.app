##### The ingredients needed to make Persimmons and sweet rice:

1. Take 1 persimmon
1. Get 3/4 cup cooked short grain white rice
1. Prepare 1/4 cup + 2 tablespoons nonfat milk

If you&#39;re not familiar with persimmons they are very soft when ripe, like a water balloon. Slices of persimmon and sweet apple combine with bitter greens, crunchy chopped nuts, and a tangy-sweet dressing. &#34;If you thinly slice kale and toss it with other tasty treats like apple, persimmon, orange, and nuts, the kale mellows out and serves as a perfect foil for other ingredients,&#34; says Chef John. Colourful and crunchy, the base is made with a wild rice blend, crunchy persimmons, and juicy oranges (or mandarines). Dried cranberries and toasted pecans both adorn and add texture, and pomegranate arils provide festive ruby-coloured accents and little pops of sweetness.

Colourful and crunchy, the base is made with a wild rice blend, crunchy persimmons, and juicy oranges (or mandarines). Dried cranberries and toasted pecans both adorn and add texture, and pomegranate arils provide festive ruby-coloured accents and little pops of sweetness. A handful of blue cheese is optional but I love the bit of creaminess. Heat a large wok or large heavy skillet over high heat. Persimmons ripen differently than other fruits, so paper bag or banana won&#39;t help.
