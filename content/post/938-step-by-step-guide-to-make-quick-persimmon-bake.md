I topped it with yogurt, but you can use soft whipped cream too. Slices of persimmon and sweet apple combine with bitter greens, crunchy chopped nuts, and a tangy-sweet dressing. &#34;If you thinly slice kale and toss it with other tasty treats like apple, persimmon, orange, and nuts, the kale mellows out and serves as a perfect foil for other ingredients,&#34; says Chef John. Thinly slice a few fuyu persimmons, cutting in a flat circular shape. Spread persimmon slices out on a parchment paper over a cookie sheet.
