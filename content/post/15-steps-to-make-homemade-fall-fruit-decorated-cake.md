This cake is a cross between a fruit crisp and a moist cake. SUMMER WATERMELON CAKE FROM THE KITCHY KITCHEN. This watermelon cake may contain more than just fruit, but we think the cake-like frosting is a clever touch! Similar to the last recipe, the frosting is made using coconut milk, honey, and vanilla bean, as well as mint sprigs and strawberries, raspberries, and watermelon balls for garnishing. Arrange the fruit in bands or rings on your cake, or in a repeating pattern that will result in individually decorated slices when you cut the cake.
