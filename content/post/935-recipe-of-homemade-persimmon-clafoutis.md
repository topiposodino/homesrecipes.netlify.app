Hello everybody, it is Drew, welcome to our recipe site. Today, we're going to make a special dish, persimmon clafoutis. It is one of my favorites. For mine, I will make it a little bit unique. This is gonna smell and look delicious.

Persimmon Clafoutis is one of the most favored of recent trending foods on earth. It's simple, it's fast, it tastes yummy. It's enjoyed by millions every day. Persimmon Clafoutis is something which I've loved my entire life. They are nice and they look fantastic.

Whisk milk, sugars, eggs, almond extract, salt, and flour together until smooth and combined. If time permits, let batter rest overnight for better hydration and a more tender custard. Persimmon Clafoutis I wanted to use up the persimmons that we received as a gift. This dessert is similar to baked pudding, which is a little firmer than regular pudding.


To begin with this particular recipe, we have to prepare a few ingredients. You can cook persimmon clafoutis using 9 ingredients and 8 steps. Here is how you cook it.

##### The ingredients needed to make Persimmon Clafoutis:

1. Take 2 Persimmons (preferrably fuyu persimmons)
1. Prepare 50 grams Unsalted butter (or margarine)

1. Get 120 grams Milk
1. Prepare 50 grams White flour
1. Prepare  Cinnamon sugar (optional)

It&#39;s sweet but not too sweet. A luke warm flan best served with a scoop of ice-cream or a cup of coffee. However, you can make clafoutis with any fruit you like, or even with veggies if you prefer a savoury clafoutis. I decided to make a typical Christmas inspired clafoutis with three seasonal fruits: oranges, persimmon, and dried cranberries.

I decided to make a typical Christmas inspired clafoutis with three seasonal fruits: oranges, persimmon, and dried cranberries. Combine eggs, sugar and persimmon pulp in a large bowl and beat with an electric mixer on medium speed until well mixed. Stir baking soda into buttermilk, then add to persimmon mixture and beat to. Most often I make a clafoutis in a black cast iron skillet or heavy pie pan because they retain the heat well.
