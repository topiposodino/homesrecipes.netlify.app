- " For the persimmons in caramel"
- "3 Persimmons"
- "6 tbsp Sugar"
- "1 tbsp Margarine"
- "3 tbsp Rum"
- " Batter"
- "110 grams Cake flour"
- "1/3 tsp Baking powder"
- "80 grams Margarine"
- "2 Eggs"
- "1 Sugar to use if you have hard persimmons"
- "4 portions Coffee creamer"
- "1 Vanilla extract"
- "10 to 15 Almonds"
- "2 tbsp Raisins optional"
- " To decorate the cake"
- "1  optional Almonds sliced almonds pumpkin seeds etc"
recipeinstructions:
- "Peel the persimmons and cut up roughly. Coarsely chop up the almonds. Separate the eggs. Sift the cake flour and baking powder together."
- "Put the sugar in a pan and heat until it&#39;s caramelized. Add the persimmons (here I used ripe and soft ones). The caramel will harden for a short while, but as you keep simmering it will melt."
- "When the persimmons are cooked through turn off the heat. Add the margarine and rum, mix in and leave to cool."
- "Cream the margarine for the batter well in a bowl using a whisk. If you have firm persimmons add 2 teaspoons of sugar to the margarine. Add the egg yolks one at a time, mixing well between additions."
- "Change from a whisk to a spatula. Mix the sifted flour in well using a cutting motion."
- "Add the persimmons cooked in caramel from Step 2 as well as the raisins, almonds, vanilla essence and coffee creamer, and mix."
- "Make a meringue with the 2 egg whites (whip until stiff peaks form). Mix half of the meringue into the Step 6 batter using a spatula and scooping it up from the bottom so as not to eliminate all the air bubbles. Fold in the rest of the meringue in the same way."
- "Pour the batter into a parchment paper lined poundcake tin and bake in a 170°C oven for 25 minutes, then at 160°C for about 10 minutes while checking the cake for doneness."
- "When the cake has risen nicely and is golden brown on top, it is done. It has a moist, dense texture. It&#39;s so delicious, and you can scarcely believe it has persimmon in it."
