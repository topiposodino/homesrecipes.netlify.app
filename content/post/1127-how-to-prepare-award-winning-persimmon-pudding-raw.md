I try to use the Fuyu because they can be eaten without any problems once ripe. Editor&#39;s Note: Use the Hachiya, acorn-shaped, variety persimmon that is ripe and soft. To scoop out Hachiya persimmons for mashing or pureeing, halve the fruit and scoop out the pulp with a spoon, discarding the stem, skin and seeds, if any.
