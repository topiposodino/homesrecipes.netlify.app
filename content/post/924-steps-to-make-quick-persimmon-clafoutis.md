Hey everyone, it is John, welcome to our recipe site. Today, we're going to make a special dish, persimmon clafoutis. It is one of my favorites. For mine, I am going to make it a little bit tasty. This will be really delicious.

Whisk milk, sugars, eggs, almond extract, salt, and flour together until smooth and combined. If time permits, let batter rest overnight for better hydration and a more tender custard. Persimmon Clafoutis I wanted to use up the persimmons that we received as a gift. This dessert is similar to baked pudding, which is a little firmer than regular pudding.

Persimmon Clafoutis is one of the most well liked of current trending meals in the world. It's enjoyed by millions daily. It is simple, it is quick, it tastes delicious. They're fine and they look wonderful. Persimmon Clafoutis is something which I have loved my entire life.

##### The ingredients needed to make Persimmon Clafoutis:

It&#39;s sweet but not too sweet. A luke warm flan best served with a scoop of ice-cream or a cup of coffee. However, you can make clafoutis with any fruit you like, or even with veggies if you prefer a savoury clafoutis. I decided to make a typical Christmas inspired clafoutis with three seasonal fruits: oranges, persimmon, and dried cranberries.

I decided to make a typical Christmas inspired clafoutis with three seasonal fruits: oranges, persimmon, and dried cranberries. Combine eggs, sugar and persimmon pulp in a large bowl and beat with an electric mixer on medium speed until well mixed. Stir baking soda into buttermilk, then add to persimmon mixture and beat to. Most often I make a clafoutis in a black cast iron skillet or heavy pie pan because they retain the heat well.
