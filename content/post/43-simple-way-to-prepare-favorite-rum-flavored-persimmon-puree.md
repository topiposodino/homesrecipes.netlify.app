Hey everyone, it's Drew, welcome to my recipe page. Today, I'm gonna show you how to prepare a distinctive dish, rum flavored persimmon purée. It is one of my favorites food recipes. This time, I will make it a bit unique. This will be really delicious.

Great recipe for Rum Flavored Persimmon Purée. I wanted a purée to spread on another dessert, so this is what I came up with. The persimmon will be microwaved without being covered with plastic wrap, so prepare a large heatproof container. If you use a small one, it will overflow and you&#39;ll end.


To begin with this particular recipe, we must prepare a few ingredients. You can have rum flavored persimmon purée using 5 ingredients and 10 steps. Here is how you can achieve that.

1. Take  ★ Fully ripened persimmon
1. Make ready  ★Sugar (adjust to the sweetness of the persimmon)
1. Prepare  ★Rum
1. Get  ★Maple syrup

I can best describe it as a lightly flavored maple pear. It simply lends moisture to baked goods the same way zucchini does. For added texture, I mixed in some toasted walnuts and chopped dried dates. The other common persimmon is the Fuyu, which is squatter than the Hachiya and matte-orange.

For added texture, I mixed in some toasted walnuts and chopped dried dates. The other common persimmon is the Fuyu, which is squatter than the Hachiya and matte-orange. Unlike the Hachiya, the Fuyu is meant to be eaten hard and is delightfully crunchy. I peel them, then mix pieces into an autumnal fruit salad along with dates, slices of Comice pears, pomegranate seeds and yes…even some bits of prunes. Finding recipes for using persimmons can be difficult.
