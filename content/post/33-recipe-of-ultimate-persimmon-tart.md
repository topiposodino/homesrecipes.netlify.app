A quick caramel sauce and easy puff pastry crust give you big payoff for very little. It should only be eaten when very ripe; when firm, the Hachiya is so astringent it can make your mouth dry to the point of numbness. It will ripen at room temperature and once ripened, the luscious, aromatic fruit is unforgettable. persimmons contain large amounts of bitter substances such as catechin, gallocatechin, betulinic acid, and shibuol which are soluble in water. Eating astringent persimmons without removing the bitterness is not only extremely unpleasant but can cause a severe health hazard. For example shibuol may polymerize when it is mixed One of my favorite fall fruits are persimmons.
