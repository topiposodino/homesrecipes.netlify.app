##### The ingredients needed to make Persimmon Pound Cake for the Autumn Season:

1. Get 150 grams Pancake mix
1. Get 1 Persimmon
1. Take 40 grams Sugar
1. Make ready 1 Egg
1. Prepare 30 grams Margarine (or butter)
1. Prepare 30 grams Plain yogurt


Stir in persimmon pulp, oil, melted butter, and eggs until well incorporated; stir in walnuts. It is the right cake for the autumn, a simple one perfect for a break in the afternoon: it has a slightly nutty taste given by the whole spelt flour, a caramel hint thanks to the moist muscovado cane sugar and slices of juicy persimmons, the fruit that best represents the season of flaming colours, the smell of fireplaces and the need of something cosy and warming to go with a cup of steaming black tea. This pudding cake is super moist and chewy, similar to an English toffee pudding cake. The persimmon fruit is a very mild tasting fruit, especially when it&#39;s baked, so I added some cinnamon and brown sugar to make it more flavorful.
