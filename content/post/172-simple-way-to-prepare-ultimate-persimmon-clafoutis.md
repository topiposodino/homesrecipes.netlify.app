Hey everyone, it is me again, Dan, welcome to my recipe page. Today, I'm gonna show you how to make a distinctive dish, persimmon clafoutis. One of my favorites food recipes. This time, I will make it a bit unique. This is gonna smell and look delicious.

Whisk milk, sugars, eggs, almond extract, salt, and flour together until smooth and combined. If time permits, let batter rest overnight for better hydration and a more tender custard. Persimmon Clafoutis I wanted to use up the persimmons that we received as a gift. This dessert is similar to baked pudding, which is a little firmer than regular pudding.

##### The ingredients needed to make Persimmon Clafoutis:

However, you can make clafoutis with any fruit you like, or even with veggies if you prefer a savoury clafoutis. I decided to make a typical Christmas inspired clafoutis with three seasonal fruits: oranges, persimmon, and dried cranberries.

I decided to make a typical Christmas inspired clafoutis with three seasonal fruits: oranges, persimmon, and dried cranberries. Combine eggs, sugar and persimmon pulp in a large bowl and beat with an electric mixer on medium speed until well mixed. Stir baking soda into buttermilk, then add to persimmon mixture and beat to.
