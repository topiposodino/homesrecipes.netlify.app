##### The ingredients needed to make Persimmon bake:

1. Make ready 1 persimmon sliced
1. Take 1 tablespoon honey
1. Prepare  Cinammon powder to sprinkle


I topped it with yogurt, but you can use soft whipped cream too. Slices of persimmon and sweet apple combine with bitter greens, crunchy chopped nuts, and a tangy-sweet dressing. &#34;If you thinly slice kale and toss it with other tasty treats like apple, persimmon, orange, and nuts, the kale mellows out and serves as a perfect foil for other ingredients,&#34; says Chef John. Thinly slice a few fuyu persimmons, cutting in a flat circular shape. Spread persimmon slices out on a parchment paper over a cookie sheet.

Thinly slice a few fuyu persimmons, cutting in a flat circular shape. Spread persimmon slices out on a parchment paper over a cookie sheet. The Hachiya persimmon, on the other hand, has an elongated, heart-like shape. It should only be eaten when very ripe; when firm, the Hachiya is so astringent it can make your mouth dry to the point of numbness. It will ripen at room temperature and once ripened, the luscious, aromatic fruit is unforgettable.
