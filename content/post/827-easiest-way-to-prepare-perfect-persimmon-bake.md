##### The ingredients needed to make Persimmon bake:

1. Get 1 persimmon sliced
1. Take 1 tablespoon honey
1. Take  Cinammon powder to sprinkle


I topped it with yogurt, but you can use soft whipped cream too. Slices of persimmon and sweet apple combine with bitter greens, crunchy chopped nuts, and a tangy-sweet dressing. &#34;If you thinly slice kale and toss it with other tasty treats like apple, persimmon, orange, and nuts, the kale mellows out and serves as a perfect foil for other ingredients,&#34; says Chef John. Thinly slice a few fuyu persimmons, cutting in a flat circular shape. Spread persimmon slices out on a parchment paper over a cookie sheet.

Thinly slice a few fuyu persimmons, cutting in a flat circular shape. Spread persimmon slices out on a parchment paper over a cookie sheet. Most persimmon pies are made as a custard pie with persimmon pulp. This one is made with sliced firm fruit and the delicious fall flavors of cinnamon and brown sugar. Make sure you are using Fuyu persimmons (short, squat-looking fruit--like an orange tomato) and not the astringent Hachiyas (large and acorn shaped).
