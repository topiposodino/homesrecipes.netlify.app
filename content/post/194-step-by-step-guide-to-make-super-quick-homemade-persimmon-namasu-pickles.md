My mother told me that dried persimmon taste great with daikon namasu pickles, so with the yuzu from my garden and flavorful dried persimmons, I made some daikon namasu. I&#39;m posting it here for my own record. Kohaku Namasu is pickled daikon and carrot, one of the traditional Japanese New Year Osechi dishes. This is not too sour to eat and the persimmon&#39;s natural sweetness increases the flavor.

##### The ingredients needed to make Persimmon Namasu Pickles:

1. Make ready 200 grams Daikon radish
1. Get 1 Persimmon
1. Take  Combined vinegar:
1. Take 1 -2 1/2 tablespoons Vinegar
1. Get 1 -1 1/2 tablespoons Sugar
1. Prepare 1/4 tbsp Salt
1. Prepare 1/2 tsp Usukuchi soy sauce
1. Take 1 Dashi stock
1. Take 100 ml Water
1. Prepare 2 tsp Salt


I chose daikon radish, carrot, persimmon, and pomegranate for my sunomono. I cut the daikon, carrot, and persimmon into matchsticks, and tossed them with the pomegranate arils. I made a light dressing from rice vinegar, sugar, and salt, and added a bit of dashi to soften the flavor. Kaki Namasu: Pickled daikon and carrot with dried persimmon Symbolizes progress, education and culture Time/Effort: * Cost: * Flavour: *** Dried persimmon adds a luscious sweetness to this pickle, but it is not something I&#39;ve come across outside of Japan, although they are a common sight in winter here, when it&#39;s slim pickings for fresh fruit.

Variation: Two-color namasu with fresh or dried kaki (persimmon) or other dried fruit This can be made either with the firm, slightly crunchy type of persimmon (the most common variety available in the US is Fuyu) or with hoshigaki, or dried persimmon.
